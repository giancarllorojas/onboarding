# Onboarding

This is the front-end of a project that I've built in 20 hours streaming for a MakerJam. It was a very ambitious take and I didn't finish on time, but had lots of fun writing my own UI with Tailwind.

It's supposed to be desktop first so it's not that responsive.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
